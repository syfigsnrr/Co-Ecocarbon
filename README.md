The Codes folder contains two scripts, model.py and validation.py, which are mainly responsible for model construction and spatial 10-fold cross-validation, respectively.
The data folder includes the site-level flux data used in this study. These data have undergone site selection, quality control, and other preprocessing steps. They have also been matched with explanatory variables based on both temporal and spatial correspondence, allowing them to be directly used as inputs for the scripts.
